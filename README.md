## D'Challenger NICS_FIREARM Challenge 

I have been a part of the NICS Firearm Challenge for the month of August.

## [About the Challenge](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/d-challenger_nics-firearm-checks-xdchallenger-activity-6964474810995212289-wvGW?utm_source=linkedin_share&utm_medium=member_desktop_web)


## Overview:
I was provided one excel file which contained 3 datasets: NICS-Firearm-Background-Checks, Explanation Sheet
The sheet "NICS-Firearm-Background-Checks" contains information about month, handgun, long gun and information about prepawn, redemption, return to seller, returned guns and private sale guns.
While the "Explanation Sheet" contains information about the different handgun, long gun, prepawn firearms and redeemed firearms.


## Objective:
Although, in this challenge objective was not defined. So, I came up with my own objectives:

* Comparing trend of Number of Redemption and Number of Pre-pawn Guns By Year.
* Comparing trend of Number of Return to Seller Guns and Sum of Returned Guns By Year.
* Top States by Permits they received
* Top States By number of guns.

## Tools Used: Power BI, Logomakr website ( for icons ), Figma


After loading the dataset in Power BI, I applied following operations:

## Steps Taken in Power BI Desktop Application:

* First of all, I started with the "NICS-Firearm-Background-Checks" sheet where guns are in different columns i.e. of types long guns, hand guns, other, etc. and same goes for
prepawn and redempted guns too.


## Original Excel Page:
[nics-firearm-background-checks.xlsx](https://github.com/amansingh1912/D-Challenger_NICS_FIREARM-Challenge/files/9388845/nics-firearm-background-checks.xlsx)

## After loading these worksheets in Power BI:

* Now, I applied simple arithmetic calculation operation i.e of DAX in Power BI, where I put several columns like Total Guns, Total Number of Redemption Guns , Total Number of Prepawn Guns,
Total Number of Return to Seller Guns, Total Number of Private Sale Guns and Total Number of Returned Guns.

* Then, I used DAX function "SUM" to calcuate SUM of all those parameters/columns which are newly made.



## Design and Visualization Part:

* I chose the color palette i.e. Brown, Orange, Green, Dark Blue and white for outline.
* From the symmetrical point of view, I took 2 columns side by side where on one side I used 6 cards whereas on the second side of column I used 4 charts of which 2 were line
charts and 2 of them are Bar charts.
* Imported icons from Logomakr.com website and used them on the top of columns used in visualization.

## Key Insights from the report:

* Texas has most number of guns.
* Washington has most number of permits.


## Conclusion:
Overall, it was a nice dataset to work around with and I loved to visualize the dataset and come with the insights from it.
